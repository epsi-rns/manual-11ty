excerpt   : 
  Get up,
  stand up (c'mon!)
  see'mon throw your hands up

Pack it up, pack it in, let me begin\
I came to win, battle me that's a sin
<!--more-->

$$ \lim\limits_{x \to \infty} \exp(-x) = 0 $$

Get up, stand up (c'mon!) see'mon throw your hands up\
If you've got the feeling, jump across the ceiling

$$ \int_0^\infty \mathrm{e}^{-x}\,\mathrm{d} $$

Feelin', funkin', amps in the trunk and I got more rhymes
