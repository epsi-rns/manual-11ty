This town don't feel mine\
I'm fast to get away, far
<!--more-->

I dressed you in her clothes\
Now drive me far away, away, away

```haskell
-- Layout Hook
commonLayout = renamed [Replace "common"]
    $ avoidStruts 
    $ gaps [(U,5), (D,5)] 
    $ spacing 10
    $ Tall 1 (5/100) (1/3)
```

Just far away and I don't care where\
Just far away I don't care
