You seem to sever all my frequencies\
I'm tethered to your energies
<!--more-->
And everything turns inside out\
I can't be killed but I'm not too proud

{% highlight "haskell" %}

commonLayout = renamed [Replace "common"]
    $ avoidStruts 
    $ gaps [(U,5), (D,5)] 
    $ spacing 10
    $ Tall 1 (5/100) (1/3)
{% endhighlight %}

All this is making things a bit insane\
And I don't care who stares or stays\
The only thing that matters is\
Will you reach out if you can't resist?
